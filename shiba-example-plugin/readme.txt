The Shiba Example is an empty or sample plugin to help you get started on writing a WordPress plugin.

== Description ==

<strong>The Shiba Example Plugin contains</strong> -
<ul>
<li>A plugin activation hook that runs when a plugin is first activated.</li>
<li>Plugin initialization functions.</li>
<li>An example plugin sub-menu page.</li>
<li>Example settings within the sub-menu page that uses the WordPress Settings API.</li>
<li>An uninstall.php file that runs when your plugin is uninstalled. Use this to clear out options (<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/delete_option"><em>delete_option</em></a>) or databases created by your plugin.</li>
<li>Example localization or language translation hooks. This enables others to easily add language translation capabilities to your plugin.</li>
