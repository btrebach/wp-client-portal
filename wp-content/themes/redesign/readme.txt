Overview:
---
Description: Redesign is a simple, clean highly visible theme suitable for blogging or businesses. The theme is not based on any other WP theme. It's made from scratch.

There are two navigation menus, custom header, custom background, header widget, two sidebar widgets, footer widget, and transparent graphic elements. The suggested measures for the custom header are 1024px x 200px.

The transparent graphic elements makes your custom background image visible through the layers. Or by choosing a background color, the hole site will appear in this color, but in different shades. An easy and fast way to create smooth graphic design.

The Redesign theme is responsive, and easy to read in handheld units. The range is from desktop size 1024px to flipped iPhone 480px. 

Future development:

A PREMIUM version of the Redesign theme will be launched soon.
